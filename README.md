# Spatial-transcriptomics reveals unique defining molecular features of fluorescence-sorted 5-aminolevulinic acid+ infiltrative tumor cells associated with glioblastoma recurrence and poor survival

## Abstract

Spatiotemporal-heterogeneity  of  glioblastoma  (GBM)  originating  from  the  genomic  and transcriptional  variation  in  spatially  distinct intra-tumor sites, may  contribute  to  subtype switching  in  GBM  prior  to  and  upon  recurrence.  Fluorescence-guided  neurosurgical resection  utilizing  5-aminolevulinic  acid  (5ALA)  has  enabled  the  isolation  of  infiltrative margin  tumor  cells  (5ALA+  cells)  from  a  background  of  non-neoplastic  cells. We  have explored  the  spatial-transcriptomic  (ST)  landscape  to  interrogate  molecular  signatures unique to infiltrating 5ALA+ cells in comparison to GBM core, rim, and invasive margin non-neoplastic  cells.  ST  analysis  reveals  that  GBM  molecular  subtype  plasticity  is not restricted  to  recurrence,  but manifests  regionally  in  a  cell-type-specific  manner.  Whilst GBM  core  and  rim  are  highly  enriched  with  Classical  and  Proneural  subtypes,  the unique  enrichment  of  the  Mesenchymal  subtype  (MES)  in  5ALA+  cells  supports  the hypothesis  that  MES  5ALA+  cells  may  drive  GBM  recurrence.  Upregulation  of  the wound response pathway in 5ALA+ cells signifies the possibility of hijacking the wound healing  pathway  of  neural  cells  to  promote  tumor  growth.  Exon-intron  split  analysis revealed an  upregulation  of  exonic  counts  for  MES  and  wound-response  genes  in 5ALA+  cells,  implying  that  these  genes  are  under  active  post-transcriptional  control. Network analysis suggests that wound response genes, including chemokine CCL2 that recruits   regulatory   T-cells   and   monocytic   myeloid-derived   suppressor   cells,   are controlled  by  an IRF8-mediated  transcriptional  program  in  5ALA+  cells.  A  higher stemness signature both in 5ALA+ cells and non-neoplastic cells of the invasive margin emphasizes  the  role  of  this microenvironment  in  stemness  acquisition  and  defines 5ALA+  cells  as  a  rare  sub-population  of  GBM  stem  cells.  Finally,  we  establish  a  link between  the  unique  molecular signatures  of  5ALA+  cells  and  poor  survival and GBM recurrence.  Characterization of the 5ALA+ infiltrative sub-population offers an opportunity to develop more effective GBM treatments and urges focus away from the GBM proliferative core, upon which failed targeted therapies have been predicated.
